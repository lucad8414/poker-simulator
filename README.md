Little Project to simulate poker.
Now just backend and analytic tools, maybe I will do some front end, but not my field.
Approaches all the objects in Poker like Cards and Hands in an object oriented way and then simulates one game.
This part is really simple, it will be more complicated, to analyze all the hands and check, what each player has and which is the strongest.
